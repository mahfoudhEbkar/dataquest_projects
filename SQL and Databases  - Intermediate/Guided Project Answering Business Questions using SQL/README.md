Use of SQL and Python to clean, analyse, visualize, and explore data	</br>

In this guided project, we're going to practice using our SQL skills to answer business questions. In each step, we'll complete a task and to do that we will need to:

Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data
Create plots where necessary to visualize the data
Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations.
